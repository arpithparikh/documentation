Contacts
========

Handshake implements a Contact Relationship Management feature through 'Contacts'. Contacts are records of individuals for note taking, labelling, associating with jobs, events, career fairs, registrations, interviews and more. Note that contacts are separate from users. In order to login and use the Handshake interface, a user account must be created. For more information on the difference between contacts and users please see :ref:`contacts vs users <application_users_contacts>`.

Managing your Contacts
----------------------

You can manage your contacts on the 'Contacts' page. Contacts are private to only your institution and are not viewable by other institutions or employers. The notes and labels on contacts are also private. The sort of details that you can record and track with contacts includes email address, name, employer, contact information, and description.

Assigning Contacts
##################

Contacts may be assigned to a member of your institution. Assigning contacts can be useful for splitting up responsibility. Contacts can then be filtered by the assigned to user.

Contact Sources
###############

In addition to manually created contacts, contact records will automatically be created for you during special events. These events include job postings, employer approval requests, interviews, career fair registrations and more. When these contacts are automatically created the 'Contact Source' will also be recorded. This allows you to easily filter contacts by their source.

Bulk Inviting Contacts
----------------------

In order to easily invite employers to use Handshake, contacts can be bulk invited through a bulk action on the management page. Bulk inviting contacts is especially convenient in that it allows you to:

- Automatically add the invited user to the equivalent contact's assigned employer
- Create pending employer approval requests for the contact's employer account once they join.
- Automatically approve any existing user's employer in the Handshake system that you invite.

Behavior of Invitation Email Links
##################################

Depending on the scenario, the behavior of a contact invite has differnet behavior. Below are the potential scenarios for a given contact.

**Contact's company does not exist yet**

#. Visit register page
#. Fill in details
#. Confirm your email address
#. Connect with schools and get an intro to Handshake, how it works
#. Don't find company on search page -> create a new company
#. If you registered with a unique email domain then that email domain is set on the employer

**Contact's company does exist, their email domain matches their company's**

#. Visit register page
#. Fill in details
#. Confirm your email address
#. Connect with schools and get an intro to Handshake, how it works
#. Find company and click on 'Join'
  #. If the company is distributed, your request must be approved
  #. If company is not distributed (only one with email domain) you are auto approved since domain matches

**Contact's company does exist, their email domain does not match or company does not have email domain or their email address is a generic one**

#. Visit register page
#. Fill in details
#. Confirm your email address
#. Connect with schools and get an intro to Handshake, how it works
#. Find company and click on 'Join'
#. Request is sent to company to be approved

Statistics
##########

After the invitations are sent out, we will record statistics on the success and reach of the invitations. These statistics include how many users have registered using the invitation, how many existing employers have been approved, how many new employers have been approved, the number of contacts who already had a user account on Handshake, and more.

Because each email is personalized to the recipient based on their current status in Handshake, the invitation process can take up to an hour to complete and process fully for larger invitations.

Using Contacts
--------------

Contacts can be used when setting points of contact for jobs, interviews, events, career fairs, career fair registrations and more. By using contacts instead of users, you do not need to require points of contacts to create a user account in order to be listed on the entity.
