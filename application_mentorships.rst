Mentorships
===========

Handshake can facilitate an array of mentoring programs. Mentorships provide a connection between students and mentors, and can be managed by administrators. Mentorships can be restricted to a subset of students using :ref:`student permissions <application_student_permissions>`.

Configuration Preferences
-------------------------

Mentoring will only show to students if there is at least one active mentor at your school.

Mentors Mange Mentorships
#########################

If this option is turned on, mentors at your school can respond to mentorship requests and view pending and declined mentorships. With this option turned off, mentors will only be able to view their ongoing and completed mentorships.

Mentor Survey
#############

If you'd like your mentors to complete any additional questions outside of the default Handshake fields, you may specify a survey with those custom fields.

Mentor User Types
-----------------

The mentor user type is separate from student, employer and staff accounts and is generally limited in what they have access to. Mentor registration can be done like normal on the registration page. If the mentor registers on your school's domain, a request will automatically be submitted.

..note:: Mentors have a one-click report download option. Filter down to the relevant items and click the download button to quickly generate a report.

Mentor Options
##############

There are additional fields available to mentor profiles.

**Student Contact Preference**: Determines how students are allowed to communicate with this mentor.

**Maximum student contacts per Month**: Determines how many students may contact this mentor, per month.

**Maximum mentees**: The maximum number of ongoing mentorships this mentor is willing to accomodate.

**Industry**: Specifies what industry this mentor is in, for better matching of students.

**Advice and Hobbies**: Quick blurbs for the mentors to provide, to help students find good matches.

Setting up a Mentorship
-----------------------

Setting up a mentorship involves three fields. The first two are the mentor and student involved. The last is the status. The status may be one of 'requested', 'declined', 'ongoing' and 'completed'. Ongoing mentorships are in progress and active.

Communications
##############

Mentors and students can communicate through Handshake's messaging feature once a mentorship is established.
