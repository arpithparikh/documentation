Labels
======

Labels are a highly configurable way to tag entities in any way unique to your institution. Often times labels can be used to meet edge case workflows and resolve scenarios where Handshake does not have a specific field desired. There are three types of labels: 'public', 'normal' and 'system'. Just about anything can be labelled including jobs, students, events, interviews, employers, contacts, registrations and outcomes.

Managing labels
---------------

Labels can be managed in School Settings. From the management page you can view each label, the number of items using that label, what type of label it is, and what sort of items are allowed to use that label.

How to Label
------------

There are two ways to label items in Handshake: Individual labelling and bulk labelling.

Individual Items
################

To label an individual item, simply open that item and label using the sidebar. Existing labels will be shown, as well.

Bulk Labelling
##############

Bulk labelling is an efficient way to label multiple items at once. The bulk labelling option is available as a bulk action. For more information on bulk actions, please see the :ref:`bulk actions page <application_bulk_actions>`.

Label Types
-----------

There are three types of labels in Handshake: 'normal', 'public' and 'system'. Although each label type is different from the other, label options (which are configured in the settings page) cannot be created with the same name even if they are different types of labels.

Normal Labels
#############

Normal labels are private to only you and your staff. These labels are not viewable by students, mentors, or staff of any other institution in Handshake.

Public Labels
#############

Public labels are still only viewable by users at your institution, but are public to students. This includes labels on students themselves being public . Public labels are useful for sharing and categorizing items for students to see, such as a group of jobs or employers.

System Labels
#############

System labels are private like normal labels, but are not manageable on the Handshake interface. Instead they are automatically synced in through the data recieved by the registrar office. When user syncs happen, any labels specified will be added to the student as a system label. Note that if that label already existed as a normal label it will be converted to a system label.

**Applying or Removing System Labels**

System labels are meant to be added and removed only during student data syncs. This ensures that the system labels are accurate and consistent. For this reason, they cannot be added or removed through the user interface.

Searching with Labels
---------------------

Once items are labelled, they can become useful through the search interface.
