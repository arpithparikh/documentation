Email Delivery
==============

Email delivery can sometimes fail due to the various systems in between handshake and students which are designed to prevent email abuse. Handshake maintains highly reputable emailing domains to ensure that emails are delivered. In order to maintain high deliverability, Handshake monitors and acts on spam scores, blacklisting, IP throttling and more.

Whitelisting
------------

Handshake sends a large amount of email notifications and depending on your school's use of the mass email feature, you should consider whitelisting handshake for more reliable email delivery. Whitelisting can better assure that emails sent to students and staff are received.
