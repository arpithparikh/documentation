Attendees
=========

Attendees are how students RSVP and attend events in Handshake. Attendee records can have a survey response for customizable survey questions, are attached to the student profile and can also require payment. Career fairs and events are attendable in Handshake.

Statuses of Attendees
---------------------

There are multiple ways an attendee status may be changed.

Registered
##########

To register for an event, click the 'Register' button when viewing an attendable. By registering, the attendee record is now 'registered'.

By registering for the attendable, the student will receive updates about it.

Checking In
###########

Students can checkin to attendables using the :ref:`checkin kiosk <application_checkin_kiosk>`. Once checked in, the attendee record will be denoted as such.

Paid
########

If an attendable requires payment, attendees have a payment status. Payment will be prompted for during the registration process and students will not be allowed to register without paying. Payment is done using our :ref:`integration with Stripe <application_stripe>`.

Viewing Attendee List
---------------------

All attendables have a user interface for reviewing the attendee list. On the attendee review page, you can review all aspects of the attendee. This includes:

* basic student details
* student profile
* registration, checked in, and payment status
* survey question responses

.. note:: Attendees have a one-click report download option. Filter down to the relevant items and click the download button to quickly generate a report.

Inviting Attendees
------------------

For invite only attendables, students can be invited directly. The simplest way to do this is by attaching the event as a card to a :ref:`mass email <application_mass_emails>` to take advantage of the auto invite feature.

In addition to mass emails, you may use the "Invite Attendees" page which provides a simple breakdown of the student demographic being invited.
