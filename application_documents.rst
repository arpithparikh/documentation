Documents
=========

Documents allow students to upload resumes, cover letters, sample work, transcripts and more. These documents are used in the application process. Documents can be required to be approved by a staff member. For more information on document or profile approval, see :ref:`Resume and Profile Review <application_resume_and_profile_review>`.

Approval Process
----------------

There are two types of approvals that occur when a document is uploaded.

PDF Conversion
##############

When a non-PDF format document is uploaded (such as docx or excel files), Handshake will automatically convert that document to be a PDF. Although the conversion generally goes smoothly, not all documents can be converted as exactly expected. For this reason we require students to approve or 'sign off' on the conversion to avoid inproperly styled PDF documents being sent to employers.

The student will be able to easily review and approve the document after it is converted. Converting documents typically takes only a few seconds.

School Approval
###############

As determined in the School Settings page, documents and profiles can be required to be approved by a Career Services Staff member. For more information on this please see the :ref:`Resume and Profile Review <application_resume_and_profile_review>` page.

Changing Documents
##################

Students may change the file of a document in only certain scenarios. If the document has been approved during document review, for example, it is not allowed.

Limitations
-----------

Handshake has requirements on the type and size of files students are able to upload. Documents must be no larger than 20 megabytes and must be a common office, text or PDF file.
