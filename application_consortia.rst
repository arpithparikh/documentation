Consortia
=========

Consortia are groups of schools on Handshake. They allow for easy sharing of data and cross-school communications.

Sharing Within a Consortium
---------------------------

Handshake allows users to share events, career fairs and interview schedules with other schools. In addition, if a school is a member of any consortia, they are given the option to share with their whole consortium. This will share with each school with one click instead of many.

Sharing Job Postings
####################

Job postings can also be shared with a whole consortium in the same way that jobs can be posted to many schools. To post a job to a whole consortium, the employer must choose each school they'd like to share with.

.. note:: Simpler consortium job sharing is in progress.
