Consortia
=========

Consortia are groups of schools on Handshake. They allow for easy sharing of data and cross-school communications.

Sharing Within a Consortium
---------------------------

Handshake allows users to share events, career fairs and interview schedules with other schools. In addition, if a school is a member of any consortia, they are given the option to share with their whole consortium. This will share with each school with one click instead of many.

Sharing Job Postings
####################

Job postings can always be posted to individual members of a consortium in the same way that jobs can be posted to many schools. In addition, consortium members can be configured to have automatic distribution or automatic approval on a per-member basis.

**Automatic Distribution**: Members with this option will automatically have any postings they approve shared with the rest of their consortium.

**Automatic Approval of Distributions**: Members with this option on will automatically approve any postings shared to them from their consortium.
