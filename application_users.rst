Users and Students
==================

Users in Handshake represent an account that can be logged into and used to access the interface. There are four types of users in Handshake: Administrators, Students, Mentors and Recruiters.

Student Registration
--------------------

In most cases, student accounts will be imported and ready for students to claim. When student accounts are not imported, students must request access to join their school. There are two ways for students to connect with their school.

Register Using School Domain
############################

If the student registers for an account using the correct domain (for example, schoolname.joinhandshake.com) and they register with their .edu email address, they will be automatically connected with their school upon confirming their email.

If they register on the correct domain, but don't use their .edu email address, a 'Student Request' will be created for approval by school administrators with the correct permissions. Only administrators with the permission to approve at time of request will see the request.

Adding an Existing Student
##########################

Existing students can be added directly by email address from the 'Manage Students' page as long as the student hasn't already joined a school.

Profiles
--------

Each user account has a profile that represents who they are. Profiles can be described as a digital version of a resume. Profile content is used to easily search for students or mentors.

Building a Profile
##################

Users can add education, work experience, projects, extra curriculars, courses, skills, organizations and external links to their profile. Building a profile is done on the user's profile page.

Parsing Resume to Auto Build
############################

An option for quickly building an initial profile is through the Resume Parser. The Resume Parser will parse an uploaded resume and automatically allow you to add the information to your profile.

Primary Educations
------------------

In order to determine what jobs, interviews, events, career fairs, articles, career plans and pins that a student qualifies for we look to their Primary Education. Every student has one Primary Education on their profile which is denoted with a label. Handshake will use the GPA's, majors, minors, and colleges from this education for screening criteria.

Locking fields on students profile
----------------------------------

Student profile fields may be locked which will disallow edits by students. This is helpful when you are importing data from your student information center and would like those fields to remain locked until the next student sync. Fields that can be locked are located in the school settings under Student Preferences. Locked fields may still be edited by staff.

Archived Users
--------------

Users are not deleted in Handshake; instead, they are archived. Archiving is a safer solution, and behaves the same as if they were deleted. Archived users are still searchable and viewable, but will be denoted as 'Archived'.

Student Record
--------------

A basic student record is available from the user profile page. The student record shows appointment history with notes from each appointment.
