Users
=====

Users in Handshake represent an account that can be logged into and used to access the interface.

Profiles
--------

Each user account has a profile that represents who they are. Profiles can be described as a digital version of a resume. Profile content is used to easily search for students or mentors.

Building a Profile
##################

Users can add education, work experience, projects, extra curriculars, courses, skills, organizations and external links to their profile. Building a profile is done on the user's profile page.

Parsing Resume to Auto Build
############################

An option for quickly building an initial profile is through the Resume Parser. The Resume Parser will parse an uploaded resume and automatically allow you to add the information to your profile.

Primary Educations
------------------

In order to determine what jobs, interviews, events, career fairs, articles, career plans and pins that a student qualifies for we look to their Primary Education. Every student has one Primary Education on their profile which is denoted with a label. Handshake will use the GPA's, majors, minors, and colleges from this education for screening criteria.

Archived Users
--------------

Users are not deleted in Handshake; instead, they are archived. Archiving is a safer solution, and behaves the same as if they were deleted.
