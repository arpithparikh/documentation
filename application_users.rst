Users
=====

Users in Handshake represent an account that can be logged into and used to access the interface. In most cases, student accounts will be imported and ready for students to claim. In some cases students must request access to join their school, such as with alumni accounts. There are a few ways for students to connect with their school.

Register Using School Domain
############################

If the student registers for an account using the correct domain (for example, schoolname.joinhandshake.com) and their .edu email address, they will be automatically connected with their school upon confirming their email.

If they register on the correct domain, but don't use their .edu email address, a 'Student Request' will be created for approval by school administrators with the correct permissions. Only administrators with the permission to approve at time of request will see the request.

Add an Existing Student
#######################

Existing students can be added directly by email address from the 'Manage Students' page as long as the student hasn't already joined a school.

Profiles
--------

Each user account has a profile that represents who they are. Profiles can be described as a digital version of a resume. Profile content is used to easily search for students or mentors.

Building a Profile
##################

Users can add education, work experience, projects, extra curriculars, courses, skills, organizations and external links to their profile. Building a profile is done on the user's profile page.

Parsing Resume to Auto Build
############################

An option for quickly building an initial profile is through the Resume Parser. The Resume Parser will parse an uploaded resume and automatically allow you to add the information to your profile.

Archived Users
--------------

Users are not deleted in Handshake; instead, they are archived. Archiving is a safer solution, and behaves the same as if they were deleted. Archived users are still searchable and viewable, but will be denoted as 'Archived'.

Student Record
--------------

A basic student record is available from the user profile page. The student record shows appointment history with notes from each appointment.
