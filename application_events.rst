Events
======

You can host and manage your on campus events in Handshake. Events in Handshake include Information Sessions, Workshops, Group Appointments and 'Other'  events. Events have attendee management with registrations and checkins, payments, comments section and more. Note that :ref:`Career Fairs <application_career_fairs>` and :ref:`Interview Schedules <application_interview_schedules>` are considered special types of events in Handshake and have their own dedicated feature sets.

Attendee Management
-------------------

Just like with Career Fairs, Events can have attendees. Attendees are records of users invited, registered, or checked in to an event. For more information about attendees, please view the :ref:`Attendees <application_attendees>` page.

Sharing with Schools
---------------------

Events can be shared with specific schools. When sharing your event with other schools, the students at those schools will be able to find, view and register for the event. Administrators at those schools will also be able to view, but will not have access to configure or edit the event.

.. note:: In addition to sharing with schools, you may also share with any consortia you are a part of.
