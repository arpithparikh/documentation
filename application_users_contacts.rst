Users vs. Contacts
==================

Handshake has both 'Users' and 'Contacts'. Although similar in that they both have common attributes such as name, email and contact information, they play two different roles in the system. :ref:`Users <application_users>` are registered accounts with the ability to login and use the Handshake interface. :ref:`Contacts <application_contacts>` are simply a record of information for CRM functionalities.

Why?
----

When creating different items in Handshake such as jobs, events, career fairs, career fair registrations, interviews and more it is necessary to have contact information for that item. By allowing you to use contacts for that information instead of users, it is much easier to add the information needed and does not require creating a login account for that person.

In addition, contacts can be used for a contact relationship system. For more details on how to use contacts, see the :ref:`contacts page <application_contacts>`. By using contacts instead of users for contact relation management, the data is controlled by you and is not lost if the user, for example, decides to delete their account.

Inviting Contacts to be Users
-----------------------------

Having contacts in Handshake for specific persons is great, but sometimes it is also desired to have them register as a user to take advantage of the Handshake interface. For more information on how to invite contacts to Handshake, see the :ref:`contacts page <application_contacts>` and :ref:`employers page <application_employers>`.
