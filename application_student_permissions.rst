Student Permissions
===================

Numerous features in Handshake can be limited to a subset of students using :ref:`labelling <application_labels>`. Applying student permissions requirements is for the whole feature set. When students are restricted to a particular feature, they will be told so, shown a custom message, and given a way to message staff for more information.

Using Labels for Permissions
----------------------------

When setting up the student permissions you will be asked to choose a label that students either *must* or *must not* have in order to access the feature. There are no restrictions on the type of label you choose.

Student Reception
-----------------

A custom message can be specified to show to students when they are given the permission denied message. The message should be informative about why they are not allowed and what the student can do to gain access. They will also be shown a list of staff members to message for more information.

.. note:: We will only show the student staff members that are marked as points of contact.
