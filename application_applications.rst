Applications
============

Applications are how students to apply to jobs and interview schedules. Applications can have multiple statuses throughout their lifecycle, have documents attached as part of the application package, and are associated with the student's profile. :ref:`Jobs <application_jobs>` and :ref:`interview schedules <application_interview_schedules>` may be sometimes referred to as "applicables".

Settings
--------

Administrators can limit the maximum number of open applications per student. In addition, you can ensure that only approved documents are used to apply to applicables by using :ref:`document and profile review <application_resume_and_profile_review>`.

Requirements
------------

Jobs and interviews often have requirements which applicants must meet in order to apply. If these requirements are not met, the student will not be abe to apply. The reasons for not being able to apply will be shown to the student.

Qualifications
##############

Students must meet basic requirements such as school years, minimum GPA, majors and more. For more details on possible qualifications, see the :ref:`qualifications documentation <application_qualifications>`.

Document Requirements
#####################

Employers can require that certain types of documents be included in the application packages. Examples of required documents include Resumes, Sample Work, Cover Letter, Transcripts or 'Other'. 'Other' can be customized on a per-applicable basis.

Applying to Interviews
----------------------

Applying to interview schedules has two different routes, depending on how the interview schedule is configured. The most common application mode is 'Students Apply through Associated Jobs'. The other option is to apply directly.

Students Apply through Associated Jobs
######################################

When this mode is picked, the student must apply to one of the associated jobs. While applying to that job, they will be given the choice if they want to also apply for the interview it is associated with. This option is on by default.

When the 'Students Apply through Associated Jobs' application method is chosen, the student is allowed to apply as long as they qualify for one of the associated jobs. Document requirements are also determined based on the job they apply through. The qualifications and document requirements for the interview schedule itself are not considered.

Students Apply Directly
#######################

With this mode, students apply directly to the interview. This is convenient for interviews that don't have associated jobs.

Withdrawing Applications
------------------------

As long as the application is still pending, it can be withdrawn by the student. When the student withdraws their application they will be prompted to also withdraw from associated interview schedules, if they'd like.

Managing Applications
---------------------

As an administrator you are allowed to manage and view your student's applications. On the management page you can filter and apply bulk actions.

Interview Schedule Application Priorities
-----------------------------------------

Interview schedules have an advanced applicant review page. On this page you can filter and choose which applicants are selected to interview. Once applicants are selected, they can be reordered using a drag and drop interface to sort between primary and alternate (preselect only).

Primaries and Alternates
########################

With preselect interviews, there are both primary and alternate applicants. Primaries can take slots before alternates, and the exact dates are configured on the interview details form.
