Qualifications
==============

Qualifications are used by various items to limit what students are allowed to view and apply to different content. Qualifications are used for jobs, interviews, articles, pins, career fairs and events.

Setting Qualifications
----------------------

There are numerous types of criteria that can be specified in qualifications.

School Years
############

Specific school years can be chosen to only allow students of a certain school year to be qualified. Leave blank to allow all school years.

GPA
###

To qualify only certain GPA's, require either a minimum department GPA or cumulative GPA.

Majors and Major Groups
#######################

Handshake uses a concept of Major Groups to simplify qualifying by major. Major Groups are a generalized collection of majors, specified by each school. Choosing major groups allows you to easily pick a common set of majors without requiring knowledge of the different majors at each school and how they differ.

In addition to choosing major groups, individual majors may also be picked. Any student who matches individual majors or a major within a selected major group will qualify.

Colleges and Labels
##################

Colleges and Labels are qualification options only available to school staff. Choose specific colleges or labels to require them, otherwise leave blank to impose no restrictions.

Automatically Updated Counts
----------------------------

In order to easily see how many students qualify for the qualifications being set, you are provided with a real-time student count. Use this to fine tune your qualifications to the desired visiblity.
