Career Fairs
============

Career fairs are a dedicated feature in Handshake in addition to normal events. Career fairs can be managed fully with booths, registrations, payments, attendees and social media sharing.

Settings
--------

Most settings for career fairs are on a individual career fair basis. Optionally, one may configure their payment preferences (for accepting credit card payments).

Career Fair Options
-------------------

Career fairs are highly configurable and can fit a large array of functionalities. Both students and employers have a unique description for the career fair. Some commonly used configuration options include:

* **Student limit**: How many students are allowed to register?

Visibility
##########

* **Status**: Drafting career fairs are not viewable by any users other than administrators.

* **Public**: Public career fairs can be searched for and found by students at other schools.

* **Hidden**: For employers only, career fairs that are hidden require a special invitation in order to view.

* **Invite only**: For students only, career fairs that are invite only require an invitation to attend. Students can be invited using :ref:`mass emails <application_mass_emails>` or the attendee invitation page.

Dates and Times
###############

Career fair start and end, student registration start and end, and employer registration start and end can all be configured.

Registration periods define when students and employers are allowed to attend or register for the career fair.

Payment Options
###############

* **Allowed Methods**: You may choose to allow credit card, manual or both payment methods.

* **Student cost**: Students can be charged a flat rate for attending. For more details, see the :ref:`attendees <application_attendees>` page.

* **Employer refund policy**: A refund policy that all employer registrations must accept.

* **Payment instructions**: Instructions shown to employers when they are asked to pay.

* **Invoice after approving**: As a convenience, administrators will be prompted to send an invoice after approving a registration.

Additional Questions
####################

In addition to the normal registration questions, you may specify a custom set of questions that employers are asked when registering. Students may also be asked custom questions when registering.

Booth Options
-------------

Booth options are what employers must pick from when registering for the fair. Booth options can be configured for price, availability, and description. 'Hidden' booth options are not shown to employers; only administrators.

Extra Items
-----------

Extra items are purchasable amenities, aside from the booth, that employers may be interested in. Examples include electrical outlet access, internet access, lunches or advertisement space.

Discounts
---------

Discount options can be added to career fairs. Only administrators are allowed to add discounts to registrations. Apply discounts before invoicing in order to ensure invoices are sent with accurate details.

Sharing With Schools
--------------------

In addition to being public to all schools, career fairs can be shared with specific schools. When sharing your career fair with other schools, the students at those schools will be able to find, view and register for the fair. Administrators at those schools will also be able to view, but will not have access to configure or edit the fair.

.. note:: In addition to sharing with schools, you may also share with any consortia you are a part of.

Registrations
-------------

Employers register to career fairs through 'Registration' records. Registrations have multiple details associated with them including the approval and payment status, and are managed by administrators.

Approval Status
###############

In order to make registering for career fairs a seamless experience for employers, they are not required to obtain 'employer approval' to post registrations before registering. However, all registrations for a career fair must still be approved by administrators.

Payment Status
##############

Registrations have a payment status which is automatically updated according to payments made and amounts due. For details on invoicing registrations, see the :ref:`invoicing <application_invoices>` documentation. As an administrator you will be able to view the invoice and payment history for the registration.

Looking For
###########

When registering, employers can specify what types of students they are looking for. This is specified through:

* majors and major groups
* job types
* employment types
* work authorization options

They can also specify the job titles they are hiring for.

Representatives
###############

Employers are asked to list the number of representatives attending the career fair and to add details about any known representatives in the form of :ref:`contact records <application_contacts>`.

Booth Assignments
-----------------

As booth options are configured, booths will automatically be built and made available for assignment. Registrations can be assigned to booths, and the employer will be informed of their booth number by viewing the registration on Handshake.
